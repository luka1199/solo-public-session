# GTA V- Solo Public Session

A simple python script to create a solo public session in GTA V.

## Run the script
```
python solopublic.py
```

## How it works

The script pauses the GTA5.exe process for nine seconds. This will cause the game to kick you out of the current session and create a new empty session for you. For you it will just look like all other players on the server are leaving your session.
